# Digit-Recognizer

The [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) was used for training. This handwritten digits database has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each image was of size 28x28 pixels.

To solve the problem `keras` package was used in R with TensorFlow backend (GPU edition).

This model had a score(categorization accuracy) of __0.99386__ on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

Future Scope: 
* Use data augumentation
* Ensemble modeling
